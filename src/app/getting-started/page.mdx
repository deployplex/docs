# Install Dosei

This is an installation guide. You'll learn how to install, run, and experiment with Dosei.

While you can install Dosei following this guide, you might also consider using [Dosei Cloud](https://dosei.ai) by creating a free account.

## Docker setup

Running Dosei with docker

```bash
docker run \
  -d --name dosei \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  doseiai/dosei
```

## The Dosei CLI

After you have Dosei up and running, you can connect using `dosei`.

External apps talk to Dosei using a TCP socket and Dosei specific protocol. This protocol is implemented in Dosei
sdks for the different programming languages.
However, to make hacking with Dosei simpler, Dosei provides a command line utility that can be used to send commands to Dosei.
This program is called `dosei`.

To install and configure `dosei` follow this two-step guide [Dosei CLI Getting started](./cli) guide.

Alternatively if you prefer not to install `dosei` locally, you can run it from the Docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it dosei dosei
```

## Test if you can connect using the CLI

The first thing to do to check if Dosei is working properly is sending a `info` command using `dosei`:

```bash
$ dosei info
{
  "server": {
    "id": ...,
    "mode": "STANDALONE",
    "address": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8844
    },
    "version": ...,
    "integration": {
      "github": null
    }
  }
}
```

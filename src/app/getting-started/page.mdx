# Install Dosei

This is an installation guide. You'll learn how to install, run, and experiment with Dosei.

While you can install Dosei following this guide, you might also consider using [Dosei Cloud](https://dosei.ai) by creating a free account.

## Docker Compose setup

To obtain the source files for the latest stable version of Dosei, run:

```bash
curl \
  --fail \
  --location \
  --progress-bar \
  --output dosei.zip \
  https://github.com/doseiai/engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

To install the Configure Dosei with Docker Compose, run the following commands:

```bash
unzip dosei.zip
cd engine-main
make configure-compose
```

Running Dosei with docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

### The Dosei CLI

After you have Dosei up and running, you can connect using `dctl`.

External apps talk to Dosei using a TCP socket and Dosei specific protocol. This protocol is implemented in Dosei
sdks for the different programming languages.
However, to make hacking with Dosei simpler, Dosei provides a command line utility that can be used to send commands to Dosei.
This program is called `dctl`.

To install and configure `dctl` follow this two-step guide [Dosei CLI Getting started](./cli) guide.

Alternatively if you prefer not to install `dctl` locally, you can run it from the Docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it dosei dctl
```

### Test if you can connect using the CLI

The first thing to do to check if Dosei is working properly is sending a `info` command using `dctl`:

```bash
$ dctl info
{
  "server": {
    "id": ...,
    "mode": "STANDALONE",
    "address": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8844
    },
    "version": ...,
    "integration": {
      "github": null
    }
  }
}
```

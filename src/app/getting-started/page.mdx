# Install Dosei

This is an installation guide. You'll learn how to install, run, and experiment with Dosei.

While you can install Dosei following this guide, you might also consider using [Dosei Cloud](https://dosei.ai) by creating a free account.

## Install Dosei

How you install Dosei depends on your operating system and whether your prefer installation method.
See the guide below that best fits your needs:

* [Install Dosei from Source](./getting-started/source-code)
* [Install Dosei on Linux or macOS](./getting-started/linux-macos)
* [Run Dosei on Docker](./getting-started/docker)


### The Dosei CLI

After you have Dosei up and running, you can connect using `dctl`.

External apps talk to Dosei using a TCP socket and Dosei specific protocol. This protocol is implemented in Dosei
sdks for the different programming languages.
However, to make hacking with Dosei simpler, Dosei provides a command line utility that can be used to send commands to Dosei.
This program is called `dctl`.

To install and configure `dctl` follow this two-step guide [Dosei CLI Getting started](./cli) guide.


### Test if you can connect using the CLI

The first thing to do to check if Dosei is working properly is sending a `info` command using `dctl`:

```bash
$ dctl info
{
  "server": {
    "id": "e741ab13-346d-4215-9472-041f9085876d",
    "mode": "STANDALONE",
    "address": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8844
    },
    "version": "0.0.9",
    "integration": {
      "github": null
    }
  }
}
```

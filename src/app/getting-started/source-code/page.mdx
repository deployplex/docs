# Install Dosei from Source

You can compile and install Dosei from source on variety of platforms and operating systems including Linux and macOS.

## Dependencies

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
* [Protocol Buffer Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)


## Download the source files

To obtain the source files for the latest stable version of Dosei, run:

```bash
curl \
  --fail \
  --location \
  --progress-bar \
  --output dosei.zip \
  https://github.com/doseiai/engine/archive/refs/tags/0.0.9.zip
```

## Compiling Dosei

To compile Dosei, run make:

```bash
unzip dosei.zip
cd engine-0.0.9
make install
```

If the compile succeeds, you'll find several Dosei binaries in the `target/release` directory, including:

* **doseid**: the Dosei Daemon (Server) itself.
* **dctl**: is the command line interface utility to talk with Dosei.

# Storage - Chroma
Dosei's managed [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) simplifies the management of your embeddings database through zero-config.

## What's included
- One-click deployment
- Out-of-the-box auto-scaling
- Private networking with your app for extremely low latency
- Automatic backups
- One-click version upgrades


## Getting started
Create a new Chroma database from [Dosei storage](https://dosei.ai/storage), select new VectorDB,
choose a new, and you are up and running in less than 5 seconds!

## Connecting

When you create your Chroma database, you will be prompted to the database overview.
There you will see your `username` and `password` which you can use as follows with the chroma sdk:
```python
user_password_base64 = string_to_base64(f"{os.getenv('CHROMA_SERVER_USERNAME')}:{os.getenv('CHROMA_SERVER_PASSWORD')}")

chroma_client = chromadb.HttpClient(
    host=os.getenv('CHROMA_SERVER_HOST'),
    ssl=True,
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Basic {user_password_base64}"
    }
)
```
Alternatively you can use [this template](https://github.com/doseiai/examples/tree/main/examples/ai-native-api) to get started, if you don't know where to start.

### Connecting privately over Private Networking (recommended for production deployments)

When you link your chroma database with one of your projects the following enviroment variables will be populated
by default.
- `CHROMA_SERVER_USERNAME`
- `CHROMA_SERVER_PASSWORD`
- `CHROMA_SERVER_HOST`

By using these variables you will be able to connect through our private network for extremely low latency and keeping
your data on a safe environment.

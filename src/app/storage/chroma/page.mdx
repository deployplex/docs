Learn how to use the DeployPlex command-line interface (CLI) to manage and configure your DeployPlex Projects from the command line.

You can install and configure deployplex using this command:
```bash
pip install -U deployplex
```

Login into deployplex to start using the CLI:

```

Alternatively you can use a deployplex token generated from the console and set it as an environment variable.

export DEPLOYPLEX_TOKEN="you_deployplex_token"
```

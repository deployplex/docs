# Cron Jobs
Cron jobs are scheduled tasks in Unix-like operating systems. They are used to automate system maintenance or administration tasks, such as backups, system updates, or routine data processing.

DeployPlex offers an opinionated approach to its use in REST APIs for ease of use. Here, you can learn how to get started with DeployPlex Cron Jobs.

## Getting started
Create a new `cron_jobs.json` on your project root directory.
```json
[
  {
    "schedule": "0 0 * * *",
    "path": "/"
  }
]
```
Is this example we are creating a schedule call to path `/` every 24 hours in the middle of the night.
Checkout [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/#0_0_*_*_*) to find other syntax formats.

## Securing cron jobs
When you define `cron_jobs.json` your project on will create new `DEPLOYPLEX_CRON_SECRET` env variable which will be rotated every new deployment.

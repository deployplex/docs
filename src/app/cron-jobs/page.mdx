# Cron Jobs
Cron jobs are scheduled tasks in Unix-like operating systems. They are used to automate system maintenance or administration tasks, such as backups, system updates, or routine data processing.

Dosei offers an opinionated approach to its use in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for ease of use. Here, you can learn how to get started with Dosei Cron Jobs.

Dosei Cron Jobs follow the same lifecycle of your project with versions following your git history, just like in your regular application source code, you can easil rollback a cron job.

Dosei Cron Jobs use the same environment variables define in your project.

## Getting started

1. Install the **Dosei SDK** in your project if you haven't already.
<CodeGroup>

  ```bash {{ title: 'pip' }}
  # Install the Dosei Python SDK
  pip install dosei-sdk
  ```

  ```bash {{ title: 'poetry' }}
  # Install the Dosei Python SDK
  poetry add dosei-sdk
  ```

  ```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
  # Install the Dosei JavaScript SDK
  npm install @dosei/dosei
  ```

  ```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
  # Install the Dosei JavaScript SDK
  yarn add @dosei/dosei
  ```

</CodeGroup>

2. Add A CronJob function to your `dosei` app

<CodeGroup>

  ```python {{ title: 'python' }}
  from dosei_sdk import Dosei

  dosei = Dosei()

  @dosei.cron_job("0 0 * * *")
  def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
  ```

  ```javascript {{ title: 'node' }}
  import { Dosei } from "dosei";

  const dosei = new Dosei();

  dosei.cron_job("* * * * *", async () => {
    console.log("Hello world!");
  });
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Now next time you roll out a new deployment, your new define cron jobs will be displayed under the Cron Jobs
tab in your project page.

### Running Cron Jobs locally
You can also run the cron jobs locally, simply run on your terminal

```bash
#         module:func_name
dctl run hello_world.main:hello_world
```

## Pricing
Cron jobs are individual definitions of functions set to execute code. Each definition counts as one cron job, and execution time is billed separately.
